In this repository you will find:
- interface.py (python GUI code)
- syle.kv (kivy language file for GUI styling)
- interface.ino (arduino c++ code)

By uploading interface.ino to arduino using arduino IDE and running interface.py using an interpreter that has kivy library installed, you should be able to control the arduino from the GUI.

(I'll add more explanations about how the communicaition works in details later)
